0,"I was contacted originally on XX/XX/XXXX via cell phone by a woman named XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX claimed to be an associate at an entity called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. She stated ( in a voicemail which I have saved ) that I must contact her by the end of the day to avoid legal action being taken for a pending legal complaint against my name and social security number in the state of Ohio. I called back and was told I owed a debt of XXXX to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' for an unpaid installment loan originating in XX/XX/XXXX. She also stated that I had committed fraud by closing my bank account used to obtain the loan. I did have a bank account closed at that time because someone committed fraud against it. I did not close it by choice. I was found liable for the charges made to my account and was forced to close the account. I did not report it to the police, I wasn't aware that I should. I told XXXX XXXX I was unaware of the debt. I almost made an agreement to repay the debt because I was scared of being sued, even if I did not owe it. I am XXXX XXXX and on XXXX. My memory is poor and I was and am still unsure if Im responsible for this debt. My husband and I decided against giving money to these people. We received no communication from them for months until yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). They contacted my husband on his cell phone, even though they were never given his number or authorized to contact him. I called them back and spoke to a XXXX XXXX, this time claiming to be from an entity called "" consumer solutions group ''. XXXX XXXX stated that I owe {$720.00} to "" XXXX '' for an unpaid installment loan originating in XX/XX/XXXX and once again, told me that I would be sued for the debt of I did not pay it. He made reference to a court docket number "" XXXX XXXX ''. When I told him he can not do that he said he would notate my response as a direct refusal and ended the call by saying "" good luck in court ''. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a call on my landline from "" consumer solutions group '' and talked to a woman named XXXX. I did not think to get her last name. I was told again that I owe the same debt mentioned above and I will be sued if I do not pay it in full. I told the representative that I am unsure whether I actually owe this debt and asked if I could call the original creditor for verification. The debt has never appeared on my credit report and to my knowledge I did not take out any installments loan in XX/XX/XXXX. She stated that "" consumer solutions group '' purchased my debt from "" XXXX '' and therefore "" XXXX '' would be unable to verify anything for me. She sent me an email, which I will attach to this complaint as documentation, listing my alleged original account number, a balance of {$220.00} and stating that the current creditor for the account is a company called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. It also lists the original creditor as "" XXXX  XXXX XXXX '' again. I will be sending a letter requesting full documentation and proof of this debt as none of this adds up, whatsoever. I also believe that even if I do owe this debt, it is beyond the statute of limitations for collection. This would make it unlawful for any company to bring legal action against me. The amounts and names keep changing and at this point I am simply scared and confused.",Action > Debt collection,
1,"Thanks for your response and update regarding Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ), my servicing company. I really tried to modify this loan but SPS is difficult in assisting me. They promised to help me with a modification but they have not kept their word. The fact of the matter is I loss my job through no fault of mine. I have XXXX XXXX and I am XXXX years old. I have been experiencing more challenges to find a decent paying job versus when I was younger with less qualification. I even contacted my Congress Woman and she has been diligent in seeking assistance! 
I have always taken my responsibilities seriously especially my Action > Mortgage to name one. The reason I am behind these payments is because I loss my job on XXXX occasions. SPS accepted my unemployment and said they will work to modify my loan when I found a job, they did not indicate the pay range that will be contingent on my modification. They denied last year due to the debt to income ratio but it they modify to make the payment affordable the ratio will adjust. It was about making home affordable last year. I have been working as of last year and making my Action > Mortgage payments but they instantly came to me to cure the loan of approx. {$11000.00} plus, granted I am scheduling Action > Mortgage payment as much as 3 in advance. 
Regarding the modification I sent the corrections they requested per your letter and as of now they have all documentations per their requests. The last request was a clarification if I am going to submit taxes for XX/XX/XXXX. Why will I evade my taxes when I have been consistent!! I sent XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX taxes since last month. I called to affirm their clarification. According to them as of XX/XX/XXXX they have all the requirements. They are threatening to take legal action as of XX/XX/XXXX if I do not cure the default amount. I have not received the letter yet but the rep. read that to me Please help me, I do n't want to lose my home!! There has to be light at the end of the tunnel!!

2,"Dear Consumers Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : In submitting this complaint, I feel the need to share just a brief history of my story. I grew up on welfare and barely made it through high school. I had a rough home life that I was always trying to overcome. I worked hard for everything I had, but struggled emotionally. 

In XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I decided to get help for my drinking. This is the way I coped with my life. I began recovery for XXXX. As a result, my whole life turned around. After a few years into sobriety, I found out that I could go to school with the help of financial aide. What a dream come true! At age XXXX I began that journey. 

I went to community XXXX for a few years then transferred to XXXX, where I worked on my XXXXr 's in XXXX XXXX. A vocation that later realized barely paid. I had a specific job that I was interested in, but they increased the requirements to a XXXX XXXX level degree. At XXXX, I went back for my XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had never married nor had kids. I met my current husband at XXXX, married at XXXX. Soon after we were married I unexpectedly I got XXXX. I was so happy. I didn't think this was possible. He is now XXXX and finishing high school. 

I graduated with my XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX at XXXX. I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and have 30 years sobriety. 

"" My loan servicer is Nelnet. I seriously don't remember consolidating. I had XXXX XXXX initially. I remember XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stating they weren't working with them anymore, but my memory escapes me on the details of the switch. 

"" I am not sure where to start? I have 20+ year old loans nearing {$200000.00}. Larger than our home loan. We are not extravagant. 

"" I have a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and have worked at non-profits for years with low pay. I finally worked my way into XXXX XXXX and started trying to pay. 

I set up an income-based plan. This was difficult because I am in XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) with contractual staff, so it is more complicated. What my business takes in and what I am paid is different, so It appears as though I make more then I really do. 

They are constantly trying to hold my spouse accountable. He did not co-sign the loans and in Michigan we are a non-community property State, plus they are not his loans. 

"" I have been paying fairly steady since XXXX of XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX - current I have paid {$26000.00}. 

"" From approximately XXXX in XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, I began receiving harassing phone calls several times a day, even though I had continued to pay almost XXXX. Since this amount was based on income eligibility, they had considered me late for a portion of what they determined I owed. Initially I was confused about this and thought I had resolved things, at least for a bit. I found out that I needed to resubmit Income based information every year for that too. Each time they would demand my spouse 's income, which I wound refuse to provide. Each time I had to do this the process got drawn out further, then showing I very delinquent for the portion that they felt I owed. All the while I continued to pay $ XXXX. 

"" In XXXX of XXXX, I finally called them, because I couldn't handle all the calls. They called my office several times a day and left VM 's on that phone, where my colleagues and contractual staff had access. They called my cell phone several times a day with random unidentifiable numbers. 

I didn't feel they were working with me and refused to stop the calls until I resolved things. There appeared to be no solution. I was so upset from sobbing that I made the statement, "" It makes a person want to commit XXXX. '' I hung up feeling defeated and exhausted. 

At the time we were packing our vehicle for a family camping vacation. A Michigan State Policeman pulled into our driveway. Nelnet had called them. They stated that if I didn't go to see someone to be evaluated for XXXX they would handcuff me and take me. My 16-year-old son and his friend were in the house waiting to finish packing for the camping trip. I and my spouse reassured the police officer that it was a figure of speech and I was just very upset. I explained that I myself was therapist and I was not going to attempt XXXX. He still refused and threatened to handcuff me unless I see someone before we leave town. He finally agreed to let me see one of my contractual therapist at my office. I did so while everyone waited in the car to drive up north for our camping trip. 

I have not been the same since. I can't talk with them on the phone because I have XXXX XXXX and sob. There never seems to be a solution. 

"" At the end of XXXX, I began paying {$1000.00} per month. Shortly thereafter I requested a short forbearance because my spouse was laid off. I was denied. So, I just didn't pay as it was the house payment, our healthcare and needed bills ( or ) the Action > Student loan. 

Just FYI - In XXXX our healthcare costs had risen to $ XXXX through XXXX with a high deductible. In XXXX, XXXX raised our premiums to $ XXXX. We finally had to switch to a different insurance with an even higher deductible to get premiums down. 

"" In XXXX of XXXX, they reported me to the credit bureau for the first time. My good standing credit plummeted. I had never defaulted, never not tried to communicate with them outside of being a late in making contact or some payments. 

Because I have a difficult time talking with them without breaking down, I sent them an email requesting them to tell me what they need me to pay and sent my income amounts. I told them I would continue to make the {$1000.00} payment until they told me otherwise. They continued to tell me I failed to provide proper information, because I did not provide my spouses income. I kept paying and would again send my information. 

I am not eligible for any forgiveness, even though I have always worked with the disadvantaged/indigenous population in some capacity, even in my XXXX XXXX. I have been in forbearance for years, not really understanding how easily my loan were increasing. I am a smart and knowledgeable woman. However, I was very nave as to what was happening, especially in the beginning. I was just trying to make my life successful and make a difference. I have never intended not to pay. However, it is impossible to meet their demands. 

"" I have been paying {$1000.00} since XXXX of XXXX. I missed my XX/XX/XXXX payment which I fully intending to pay, got busy and keep forgetting. 

"" On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$1000.00} payment. Later that evening I opened my mail and received a letter from Nelnet requesting that I pay the full amount of my note, {$190000.00}. If I did not pay or try to resolve within 30 days from the date of the letter, they would consider me default, garnish my wages and take our taxes. The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX. I received it on XX/XX/XXXX. This gives me approximately 2 weeks to figure this out. 

I am scared of losing everything I have worked so hard for. I have a successful XXXX XXXX with on-going wait list, that I love. The dream I had has turned into a complete nightmare that is slowly beating me down. The dream of my XXXX son going to college is also gone. I don't want him to go through the same thing I am, which for a parent is very is sad. 

I don't know what to do?? I am going to try to consult an attorney for a better understanding of the legalities of this. I need some guidance and clarity as to how to deal with all of this. I am finding so many that are going through the same thing on the internet. I continue to look for information, but I have to come up for air and set aside now and them. If there is guidance you can give me to help me deal with all of this, it would be greatly appreciated.

61,"Midland Management sued me after the statue of limitations had run out on a credit card account that was time-barred. The card still appears as an open account on my credit report which I recently ordered. Midland Credit Management XXXX claimed that they bought the credit card account from XXXX and that makes the card a personal account now, and thus, it is no longer an open account. I have never seen anywhere in all the research that I have done that an open account becomes a personal account after it is sold. In XXXX, the statue of limitations is three years on an open account and fifteen years on a personal account. If they can claim this as their defense then how is the statue of limitations protecting consumers if rules/laws can be changed to benefit these companies that buy these accounts on XXXX cents to the dollar and then add other charges? I would be interested in knowing if this is true in other states or only in XXXX? This is hurting many working families in XXXX and I feel that it is causing more damage than the XXXX debt we are facing because these are individual families.

66,"The reason for this complaint is that XXXX, XXXX and XXXX do not have the correct information on my credit report regarding my Action > Mortgage with Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ). After multiple written requests to SPS, they no longer even investigate the inaccuracies. I am asking the CFPB to review the written evidence provided and intervene again with SPS. If I am correct, I am asking the CFPB to assist me in making sure my credit reports with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX are accurate. 
I purchased a home in XX/XX/XXXX for {$130000.00}. My Action > Mortgage was serviced by XXXX until late XX/XX/XXXX. Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ) was selected as my new servicer as a result of the National Action > Mortgage Servicing Settlement in early XX/XX/XXXX. 
Due to the XXXX, I received an offer to modify the Action > Mortgage on my home with a reduction in principal. I received the offer letter via fax on XX/XX/XXXX from SPS. I contacted SPS to get wire instructions to pay SPS. That same day, I requested that a wire be sent for the amount of the XXXX initial trial modification payments to SPS. SPS confirmed receipt of the funds less than XXXX days later. The offer letter is included, the page of the bank statement that shows the payment for XXXX months of the {$210.00} monthly payment ( total of {$650.00} ). 
The Action > Mortgage modification agreement specified that I make payments of {$210.00} on or before XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. All three months of payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX via a wire of {$650.00}. 
My understanding of trial modification is that payment are held in suspense accounts for the XXXX months of the trial modification. During that time, no negative data should be reported to credit bureaus. SPS reported that XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments were at least XXXX days late. XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were not reported at all. SPS claims that because they were understaffed to handle all the modifications and it took until XX/XX/XXXX to get a final modification done my XXXX on time payments do not count. 
I am asking that the CFPB look at the modification offer, the copy of my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement and take action against SPS. I believe that XXXX law requires that information from creditors be reported accurately to credit bureaus. Their report is not accurate. 
I have made all payment starting from XX/XX/XXXX until today on time based on the offer from SPS. If I am correct in my reasoning, I believe that it would be fair to have my credit report show either on-time payments beginning XX/XX/XXXX until today or XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX showing no entry and XX/XX/XXXX until today should show on time payments on both of my credit bureaus. That is what happened. 
Separately, the highest balance of my Action > Mortgage shows {$40000.00} on my credit report. This is not correct. I have attached a copy of the recorded Action > Mortgage showing that it was {$130000.00} originally. The highest balance on my credit report should show {$130000.00}. That is the accurate amount. I am asking that the {$130000.00} be shown as the original amount. 
I previously have contacted XXXX and XXXX and provided them the same information I have provided the CFPB. They left the data unchanged and "" verified '' the data as correct. I asked how it was verified and the credit bureaus stated that they contacted SPS. I do not understand how a reasonable person can see the information provided and state that my credit report is correct. 

The CFPB has previously taken action against SPS. They had problems in the past with multiple regulatory agencies. They should be held accountable for the damage they do to people 's lives. They are shameless in not taking responsibility and correcting their mistake.",Action > Mortgage,

They stated that they ca n't really determine anything about "" quality of service '' and they are going to go with the Doctor 's office anyway. I stated, if you do n't do anything with quality of service disputes, why would they proceed with a dispute that could result in my "" medical records '' being released to them unnecessarily. I asked what documents could I provide to support my dispute and they stated they tend to go with the Doctor anyway because they have no way of evaluating quality of service. XXXX from Collections never disclosed what information I could provide for the dispute process or that the do n't judge the necessity or quality of medical or XXXX services required. I was never advised about my personal medical records being released and that they ca n't assist in quality of service issues when it comes to "" medical disputes '' before acquiring my personal medical records. No one ever stated that my medical records may have to be accessed in the process of the dispute. Then they kept stating that my medical records were not accessed but my XXXX consent was sent which specifies certain specifics of my XXXX to be done. I also did not provide any supporting documentation because when I asked what could I provide, they did not inform me that I could provide any supporting documentation.

She does not put correct updates or information that we give her in the computer system. She does not answer calls when transfered to her ext. We have spoken to others in her department more often than speaking with her. 

The other issue we have is trying to be changed from the short sale review over to the home saving options review even after submitting all paperwork. It has been 30 days from the day we made that request and sent in all paperwork that was asked for. The Action > Mortgage company have been telling us that there are no updates at this time.",Action > Mortgage,
97,"I applied for a home Action > Mortgage with BB & T on XXXX/XXXX/2015. My settlement date was scheduled for XXXX/XXXX/2015 -- a significant amount of time for a Action > Mortgage lender to provide a credit decision. This contract period was designed specifically to allow the lender time to complete extra due diligence for the type of loan program I was pursuing ( XXXX ), as well as alleviate any challenges they could possibly face by having an end-of-month rush XX/XX/XXXX. I have previous experience as a Action > Mortgage Loan Originator, so I understand what documentation and promptness it requires on the borrower end to get a Action > Mortgage approved in a timely fashion. Throughout the process with BB & T I submitted thorough documentation, and never once did I take more than 24 hrs to provide additional requested documentation. Despite having 62 days to complete the loan process the lender did not begin pursuing the initial underwriting phase until after 40+ days of possession of the file. Even after going to underwriting it took 12 days to get a response of the initial loan conditions -- something that takes 2 days typically. I communicated frequently with BB & T that there was insufficient time to complete the approval process at the pace they were moving and nothing was done to speed things up. 
A XXXX loan requires 3 things : 1 ) Approval of an FHA Loan by the lender, including provisions for the XXXX program overlays. 2 ) After approval, the loan goes to XXXX for review and approval 3 ) The loan is sent back to the lender for closing and funding. BB & T is fully aware of this process. They did not manage to send the loan to XXXX until the end of our scheduled closing date, and it is currently still held at XXXX today, XXXX/XXXX/2015. The causes of this are nothing more than mismanaged time and inattention to detail. Perhaps due to the fact my loan was not large enough to warrant significant attention ; I do n't know. There was XXXX minor issue on the loan that required last-minute documentation ; these documents were requested XXXX/XXXX/2015, and promptly provided XXXX/XXXX/2015. This XXXX minor issue can not be blamed for holding up the loan approval process, as this should have been visited at least 10-15 days prior. 
BB & T 's negligence and failure to act in my best interest have caused me not only distress, but additional costs which can not be recouped. I also used all my vacation time from work to complete a move that was supposed to begin 5 business days ago, so I 've depleted my resources as well. It 's not about the money or the inconvenience however, because I know everyone has their own sob story. It IS about the fact that my loan approval process clearly did not matter to BB & T, and any ramifications of their shortcomings to provide a quality service were not of importance to them. If I could see ANY evidence that BB & T at least gave me their best effort to provide a timely closing I would take no issue. I understand things come up, and real estate settlements frequently do not go according to plan. This is not the case however. BB & T has not shown me a best effort, or even a "" good '' effort, towards closing on my required date. No urgency was applied to my loan until within 5 business days of the scheduled closing, which was too late given the fact the loan file had to be sent to a third party. 
I am not even certain I take issue with any XXXX person at BB & T necessarily. I am however supremely dissatisfied with their failure as a Action > Mortgage company, and I am certain that not ALL substantially similar borrowers are experiencing what I have, nor ALL XXXX loan applicants. No one can give me a justifiable explanation why MY loan has gone this poorly. If BB & T is a Action > Mortgage lender they need to be fair and responsible. I was treated unfairly, and even more importantly BB & T has acted irresponsibly which is unacceptable for a financial institution.",Action > Mortgage,

172,"Today ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) at XXXX, I stopped at the Wells Fargo branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , CA XXXX. Upon attempting to make a payment for my auto loan, I was informed that the loan had been closed. I then called Wells Fargo Dealer Services at XXXX and I spoke to an agent on the phone at XXXX. The agent informed me that the loan had defaulted due to 120 days past due. I have made XXXX payments in the past 120 days, XXXX in XXXX and XXXX as recent as XXXX XXXX, XXXX. They keep the payment date rolling for as to which month my payment applies to, to tip the scales into their favor in order to seize my car, which is worth approximately twice what I owe ( repo incentive ). I then asked the agent if the car had been put out for repo, to which he initially declined to comment on. I was not contacted by WFDS with any kind of notice or alert to the account, and never once notified to the error of applying payments to the month that WFDS so chooses in their favor. 

The ill-fated relationship with WFDS began in XXXX XXXX when I lost my job. That was the first time since taking on the loan ( XXXX XXXX ) that I had missed a payment. WFDS began to harass me with calls. The specific gentlemen who launched this campaign goes by the name XXXX. By XXXX, I headed to a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, NV to open a personal bank account, during which I asked the branch manager to call WFDS on my behalf to get the amounts I need. I explained the phone harassment and my lack of confidence in wanting to call them to settle it myself. I was able to pay the amounts once I knew them, and I also requested a copy of the loan through the branch manager. They were going to fax her XXXX and they never did, despite an additional call from the manager. 

In XXXX XXXX, I began receiving calls again from WFDS, often making my phone ring no less than twice a day- and if I picked up, most of the time they would hang up. I saved the number in my phone since they called so frequently. In fall XXXX, I spoke to the highest person, XXXX. I explained how harassed I felt, but specifically the low-talking gentleman named XXXX. She promised that XXXX would never call me ever again, not even once. It was a promise made on a recorded call that sits somewhere in WFDS data repository. He called many times after. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was treated the most disgracefully up to date. I was immediately harassed by, not XXXX, but XXXX separate agents in XXXX separate phone calls. I then explained how XXXX payments had been made and I was told that they could n't find it, it 'had n't shown up in their system. After XXXX minutes of going back and forth they caught the mistake ( and I believe got XXXX involved ) and explained that XXXX of the payments had been applied to the principal, and I had now been hit with a late payment penalty! I 've never gone through such a hard time to prove that I was being truthful, and on XXXX of all days of the year. 

This message has been significantly truncated, but I have more noted instances of harassment and targeting by numerous agents at Wells Fargo Dealer Service ( XXXX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and more ). There are many people close to me that are aware of my distraught relationship with Wells Fargo Dealer Services and how much anger and anxiety they cause me, to the point where I am willing to get an attorney involved if it can be done at a reasonable retainer. I am not seeking to win judgment, I just believe that even if I lost, I would be vindicated by deposing all Wells Fargo Dealer Services agents and staff under oath and playing all phone recordings before a judge. There are always biased instances where customers are upset at a company. In my case, I do believe there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that proves that I have been unfairly targeted by WFDS",Action > Consumer Loan,

It was noted that I need not do ANYTHING further to consider account # XXXX as a PayPal Credit account ( please see Evidence XXXX ). 
You can link your PayPal Credit account to PayPal.com account. However, my original PayPal Credit account ( # XXXX ) ended up being the linked account on the PayPal.com website ( never offered a selection ), with NO ability to link the new, secondary PayPal Credit account ( # XXXX ). I had no idea the functionality worked like this, nor was this disclosed in the PayPal Credit FAQs ( see Evidence XXXX ). Thus I began paying down the PayPal Credit as usually ( # XXXX ) as shown through the PayPal.com website and completely paid that balance to zero ( see Evidence XXXX ). 
Little did I know that # XXXX was never linked to PayPal.com, so I had no visibility into the account or to access statements. I did not know that I had to go to the OLD Bill Me Later / XXXX site to make payments as PayPal was even calling the new product PayPal Credit!

When I called your offices all I was told that they responded but they could not view the whole document. Big surprise. This is typical with what I deal with when speaking with Wells.

In XXXX I had contact to them to see what we could do in terms of modification. We were not behind in our loan in XXXX and I called to talk to them about refinancing. I asked for the Prospectus on the trust they put my loan in. The response was check sec.gov wells fargo Action > Mortgaged back securities XXXX. Very helpful if I could actually access that document. The process is neither easy or clear and I worked in XXXX for 16 years. I asked them to get me the prospectus and show me where it says the Action > Mortgage can not be modified and that no one else has been. Back to XXXX. So in XXXX they said we said we could not offer HAMP and nor could we ever. Well infact in XXXX  we were offered {$40000.00} in hamp to put towards a XXXX payment to wells. We would have to put {$35000.00}. This came about at a settlement hearing in court. We made XXXX too much in income. So Wells has dragged this through the courts for years and then comes up with something that would have worked one year or even 6 months before. My lawyer was at the settlement conference. They made the offer through him. Also they say they offered us forbearance but they actually kept language in that alluded to the fact that they could still foreclose even after we paid them. We got no actual modifications offered to us and we know they have foreclosed on people even after they have said they wo n't. They say they did n't receive paperwork but we know they did because we would fax and overnight and then call and refax. We are selling our house so it seems to me they get paid twice, because they sold this loan, because they will get proceeds from this house and because they will probably get insurance. Also, did n't they get money to help homeowners. I would like to see one Wells Fargo helped. I can pay my Action > Mortgage. I did n't ask for this process to take five years. I know they could have helped us if they wanted too which is the operative word. Our loan was a nightmare. XXXX dropped the piggyback like a hot potato and does n't want us to pay anything.

In XXXX I began a re-finance process on my home and discovered Ally had reported my account 30 days past due for the XXXX payment, although the XXXX was received on time. I called Ally to dispute and was told I would get a resolution within XXXX to 6 weeks. In 6 weeks I received a letter stating the dispute was not valid and the account was reported past due correctly. I called Ally and requested escalation to a supervisor and spoke to a person that said they would re-open the case and I would receive a call back within XXXX hours. I never received the call. I called again, requested escalation, spoke to a supervisor who then said there was no record of my last call and that I could file a new dispute and hear back in XXXX to 6 weeks. I repeatedly requested to speak to a manager or someone directly in the credit dispute department and was denied. My only option was to again wait XXXX to 6 weeks. Again 6 weeks and I hear nothing so again I call. I immediately request a supervisor than that supervisors manager. I get transferred to the "" consumer affairs '' department. I again go through the history and request to speak to someone in the credit dispute area. The individual told me they have no way to transfer however, I would receive a call within the next XXXX48 hours. This time 48 hours later I do get a call from "" XXXX ''. I was not home at the time, and a message is left to return the call. I returned the call within XXXX hour to the number provided ( same main number ). I get transferred to "" consumer affairs '' again, and then told XXXX was not available. And she will be out for one week. I ask to speak to another manager and was told no-one was available. My only option is to wait. A week goes by, no return call. I call again, get transferred to consumer affairs, ask for XXXX, was told again she was out for 3 more days. Wait 3 days, no return call, I call again, get transferred to consumer affairs, ask to speak to XXXX 's manager or anyone in a leadership role in the credit dispute department. I get told I would get a call back within XXXX48 hours. I told the rep that this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced and wanted to formally complain. The rep told me all complaints must be in writing, she could not discuss over the phone. 

Another interesting point is with every call, they state how their service is very important and if you would like to participate in a survey, press XXXX and stay on the line after the call ends. I have done that each time and never been offered a survey, just dead air. 

To summarize, It is near to impossible to escalate any issue or speak to anyone within any managerial authority with Ally. My XXXX payment was not late. Due to Ally not sending a XXXX bill, I was not aware the payment increased XXXX. I am still unclear on why the XXXX payment had decreased. When notified of the XXXX difference, it was immediately paid. Given that the XXXX payment was never 30 days past due.",Action > Consumer Loan,

Because I had made my payments on time and did n't walk from my underwater house like most others, I was eligible for the harp program. I went through the process and refinanced at an interest rate of 4.625 %, which was 1 % higher then the market rate at the time. My loan XXXX told me that the HARP program carried higher rates because of the risk premiums due to the home being underwater. I was also told by the loan XXXX that I had to use Wells Fargo for the refinance because only the current Action > Mortgage holder could refinance under the HARP program, so, I had no ability to shop. The refinance still made sense financially at the time so I proceeded. I received a call recently from that same loan XXXX informing me how low rates are and offering to refinance me. When I explained to him that he already refinanced me under the HARP program and that my understanding was that we could not again he indicated that he never used that program for me, rather, he used an internal program that wells fargo created that was similar to harp. He must have forgotten all of the lies he told me originally. I explained to him that my home is still underwater so a normal refinance would not work unless they had a similar program they could refinance me. He agreed and said they do not have any programs that could refi me if I am still underwater and that HARP could not either because my new loan was originated after XX/XX/XXXX. So, I was misled and deceived to believe at the time of my refinance in XX/XX/XXXX that I was refinancing under the government program HARP and had no ability to shop so had to take what they were giving me only to find out that it was a made up program so wells fargo could make as much interest on me as possible. I am a business man and understand the importance of maximizing your profit, however, This program was created for those who were doing right thing and making their payments on time, despite the fact their home was over 100 % underwater, to help make things affordable. I could have just as easily walked away like most other did and stick them with my house that is still underwater by XXXX. But still, I was offered a rate of 1 % over the market rate at that time and am now stuck in this loan because of their deceiving practices because I am still underwater. This program was to help the American consumer but wells fargo still found a way to take advantage of me. I have dwindled most of my savings to keep up with the payments and am simply asking for Wells Fargo to do the right thing and refinance me ( not modify ) at a 3.625 % rate, which is the rate I should have been offered and closed at in XX/XX/XXXX.

250,"( copied from my letter to Experian ) XXXX Attn : Customer Care XXXX, TX XXXX Dear Experian, Well that was sneaky. You know I 'm after my FICO credit score and a credit report, so you lead me down a path on your website promising a free credit report. Once you have my personal info you inform me that it costs {$1.00} to report the FICO score, which seems reasonable so I enter my credit card info and press OK ... 

... not reading the small print two paragraphs below which says that in fact I was signing up for a $ XXXX recurring charge. 

I 'm sure you can cite letter of the law that nothing is amiss, but this is clearly meant to trick people into a recurring charge. What I and I 'm sure 90 % of your customers want is a one time credit report. The transaction as presented seems like I am paying {$1.00} for a simple credit report. It would be a more uncommon thing for someone to want a continuous and relatively expensive monitoring of their account. 

A monitoring service is a separate product from seeking a credit report, and should be sold as such. You should not have to sign up for a {$260.00} per year service just to see a one time credit report. 

Experian is in a uniquely powerful position in the financial industry. You are in the business of gathering personal information and making judgements on credit worthiness. To offer a credit report service that borders on a scam is troublesome. 

I would appreciate a refund of the {$21.00} charge that was made to my credit card, which you have kept on file. Thank you.",Action > Credit reporting,

My income increased last year. I filed the paperwork to renew the income based repayment plan, aware that my monthly payment amount would increase. I was surprised to find howeveer that my payment had increased to 400 % of the prior year 's amount.

I informed the company that I was willing to extend the term of my loan or look at any other options that would prevent me from defaulting. I was told that my income based repayment could not be adjusted. In an online chat with Navient. was told that I could call the company, make a payment of whatever I could afford in order to exit the income based program, and then the company would help me enter into another payment plan ( such as an extended repayment period ) that would help me afford my payments. I called the company to do so ; and was told that I would need to make an immediate payment of $ XXXX in order to exit the income based plan and to even see what my options would be under another plan.

275,"This was an issue in loan closing for the house we bought from Lennar in XXXX. My wife and I felt that pages of signed Loan Documents we signed from the assigned Mobile Notary were lost. XXXX was the designated title company for this particular deal and they contracted a mobile notary to come to our residence in XXXX to sign the loan documents. This procedure was meticulously undertaken and took over an hour to complete. Thick duplicate copies ( loan documents ) were left in our possession wrapped by a rubber band when the notary left. We were also told that she will review these signed documents, stuff it in an envelop and mail it overnight to XXXX. The following day, we got a call from the loan officer who informed us it can not be recorded since there are missing loan document pages and he was told that these pages were retained by borrower. Since my wife and I were in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, we drove to the office of XXXX to sign the alleged missing paperwork that day. Much to our surprise, the in-house notary brought out more than 10 loan forms that needs to be re-signed and most it, based on our recollection, were presented and signed in our residence in the presence of mobile notary. It presented a big red flag since it now appears somebody has these missing documents with our signatures. It was also discovered by the in-house notary that the Loan documents we were signing were in error since only my wife 's name should be in the loan and the Title will be in both our names ( underwriting error? ). This precipitated the re-drawing of a new loan documents. So we ended up signing 3 loan documents for this purchase. 
But recent email sent to me by the Title company contains a flimsy excuse to close this issue. They have accepted the mobile notary 's explanation that in the course of printing the second set of loan documents, the printer run out of ink and has to go to an errand to buy replacement. This caused skipping pages, thus the missing documents. However, due diligence will dictate that one has to compare the pages on computer file and the printer output. Another way is to compare the last printout with the first set that was complete ( We were told that we have the first batch that is why it is complete ). Surprisingly, the notary came to our residence without counter-checking the integrity of these loan documents. Finally, after leaving our house, the notary went to the office where an audit could have been performed prior to mailing these documents. 
I know that an admission for losing pertinent credit information, deliberate or accidental, is a serious matter since it put borrower 's information in jeopardy.

I have documents to prove this. I had a stop payment issued to protect me. But Cash Central emailed me indicating the illegal attempt to debit. 

I am now trying to work with an attorney to help me with settlement or bankruptcy as too far behind to make timely payments. 

Is there a fine that can be issued to Cash Central for their illegal actions? If so, perhaps I can pay my debts with that money and be spared any further hardship.

1 ) I let the person that called on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX know that I did n't even know I owed a debt to XXXX, as I have a current account with XXXX and never received a bill or notification that a debt was owed. She was unsure why and I let the representative know that I would have to call her back ( I was driving and not able to look up any specific details, but my wife was witness to this phone call as it was on speakerphone and it should also be recorded as it was stated by the representatives for the company that "" all calls are recorded '' ). The representative advised me that she would open a dispute to investigate this further, but advised me that this would be reported within 45 days of the company getting the account. This allows the company to report to the credit agency, even during a dispute that would result in, if done accurately, the agency finding out that this dispute is, in fact, relevant and non-frivolous. She assumed I was supposed to believe that this alleged debt was true, although I have not received or been sent anything in writing. 

2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I called this company again to see what I could do about this debt, as I am trying to buy a house and did n't want the debt to report to my credit, even if I was n't sure why it existed in the first place. I wanted an idea of the options available for this specific alleged debt, before I did more research about the debt ( I am still unsure about its validity ). I was told that they would settle the amount for {$900.00} and some dollars, although the debt was approximately {$1300.00} as stated from a female representative. I told the representative that I was not able to do this.

She stated they would report it to my credit "" on or about 45 days '', and would n't be able to verify that if I paid this unverifiable debt within 45 days that it would n't be reported on my credit. She stated they received the debt on XXXX XXXX, and could n't guarantee that it would n't be reported on XXXX XXXX, although the furnisher laws and FCRA state that the company requesting the information must only report information that they know is valid. The company stated that they would request to send a bill ( which I have n't received ) but the bill will get to me in 60 days ( although they are required to get the bill to me within 5 days in writing ) of proof of the debt. They stated by the time I get this bill, they would have already reported it to my credit, without verifying its accuracy. I let the representative know that I could n't do this right now ( as I wanted to do more research and do not want to pay a debt if it does n't exist ). She stated if I did n't pay it - they would n't settle with me or help me at all try to resolve this and that they would damage my credit. I ended the conversation on that threatening note.

She stated that she has "" 30 to 60 days '' to request something and get it sent out in writing, and would not send it via any other method. I immediately contacted my retained counsel, who told me to call back and advise the company that according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, they have to get me this information within 5 days, and are not allowed to report to my credit until I have a chance to receive this information.

After giving them my personal financial information, they could only "" settle '' for 60 % of what the debt was, versus other people who are getting the company to settle with them for as low as 25 % of the debt that they owed.

There are complaints from consumers stating this company calls for false debts that do n't exist, calls for debts that they promise not to report and after they receive payment will report anyway, and that the company will report debts from over 10 to 20 years and report it as a recent delinquency to impact and harm consumer 's credit. They are not following the FTC or the FCRA and need to be investigated. There are too many people being damaged by this company. It is the debt collector 's job to verify the debt, and they are too busy threatening to report the debt that they are n't even able to verify exists because they state they have to contact their internal department to "" get the information from the original creditor ''. Should n't they have this information from the original creditor already? They are trying to report something that they do n't even have verifiable proof from the original creditor, are being told does n't exist. The law states they have to have "" no reasonable doubt '' that the debt exists to report it and are not allowed to report inaccurate information. 

I am being threatened that Convergent will report to my credit and harm my credit if I do not pay a bill that they will not send me in writing. They will only state that I owe a bill telephonically, and expect me to believe them. They are going to report it months before they send me anything in writing ( which they will not be able to as this debt just does not exist ), and I believe are committing fraud.

This loan is now being managed by Firstmark Services a Nelnet company.Documents that I have requested are : Signed Promissory note, signed disclosure statement, payment history, payment schedule, a copy of the check that was released, and a signed release of funds form.I have been sent some documentation that I have requested, but the company is making it very hard to get anything. What Firstmark has sent me that they list as promissory note is the only documentation that they have been able to send me that has a signature. The signatures that are there are a mine and another. Our signatures appear under "" BY YOUR SIGNATURES BELOW ; YOU CERTIFY THAT YOU INTEND TO APPLY FOR JOINT CREDIT AND BE JOINTLY LIABLE WITH THE BORROWER FOR THIS LOAN. '' This is the only signature that I have been provided with a document that is very hard to read only listing that by signing we INTEND apply. In this document it explains that both the collage and I would need to endorse the check. They did not send me a copy of any check showing endorsements and are unable to do so. They sent me a copy of an alleged electronic transfer stating that the begin date was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX but where our signatures are stating that we intended to apply was dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. How is it possible for a transaction to start four months prior to an application even being filled out? With them sending a copy of an electronic transfer I requested a signed release of funds form and payment schedule on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and have yet to see anything from Firstmark about this documentation. I have been waiting for these documents and today I received a call from Firstmark today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX telling me that If I do not make a payment today that I will go into default.

I explained that I had saved all of the emails during this time and that I have not seen anything from them since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I had last spoken with them about what information still needed to be sent. The representative stated that she "" thought '' it had been sent. I asked today for a copy of the email that was sent to me between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX along with the date and time stamp from the email they are saying they "" thought '' they sent me. I never received a copy of a payment schedule or what my payment amounts should be, and the payment history that I requested was sent to me in XXXX separate documents XXXX of which is a excel document that can be changed by anyone. Looking at the payment history there is no explanation or reasoning, as to why the amounts to principle and to the interest are all over the place. For example my father has been making {$110.00} payments one month they will apply {$38.00} to principal and {$69.00} to interest then the next month {$24.00} to principal and {$80.00} to interest. It is like this during the whole time there have been payments. Firstmark has been unable to provide me all of the documents that I have requested and when needed created documents.

Attached please find the documentation from the bank stating the approval. However, only a few days later when I was preparing to make a morgage payment online, I noticed a negative balance of {$320.00} on my account. I immediately proceeded to contact BOA at XXXX and was advised that my HomeOwners Insurance Company billed. However, they failed to disclose that it was at their request. 

I contacted my insurance company where I received the fax they received from the bank dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) - just a day after the letter ( attached ) dated XX/XX/XXXX where escrow was already removed. The letter requested that the account be changed to "" Action > Mortgagee billed ), which resulted in the bank paying the balance on the policy. My policy was in good standing, my escrow had just been removed and there should have been no reason for this transaction to take place. 

I proceeded to immediately contact the bank and was advised to just repay the {$320.00} to the bank and no further issues would arise. I contacted my Account Manager ( XXXX ), but never a clear resolution to date. I requested an update as to why this occured to begin with and was told that I was approved for a "" Pre Trial for a Home Loan Modification '' something I was denied back in XX/XX/XXXX when initially applying and did not understand the reason for now being approved and advised I was not interested. 

A home loan specialist advised that I immediately send in a signed letter declining this offer that I never accepted, to prevent any other issues ( including escrow ). Attached you will find the letter faxed immediately on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received confirmation that I was no longer eligible for the "" Trial Period '' as I declined - hoping all would now return to normality. I in return made my payment to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX to satisfy the payment should have not made - but made anyhow on my behalf of {$320.00}. 

I continued to patiently wait for notification from my account manager that my account would not incur any escrow due to this bank error - yet no concrete resolution. My taxes then became due for XX/XX/XXXX and I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I in turn checked my online banking to find out the bank made a payment on XXXX. Another payment that should not have occurred ; which I was trying to avoid since XX/XX/XXXX.

I have tried to contact the customer service number with no luck as I am redirected to my account manager who I go a week at a time without being able to contact, I sent an email via the Bank of America portal to receive a response on my city taxes and escrow removal - and received the attached documents. This was a bank error that should never have taken place, I should not have an escrow account, my account in showing negative as a result of the city tax payment I was responsible for that I made on time to the city ( of which there is no way I will make another payment to the bank for a payment already made ). 

I am simply requesting that the bank correct the system error made on their end, whether that being departments not accurately touching base with one another, correspondence crossing, etc. Attached you will find my response to the bank sent today with attachments, of which I know will be disregarded due to this negative escrow they are showing which should not be in my account.

308,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by an XXXX from what he stated was XXXX XXXX XXXX. The first call was to my place of employment, on my day off, but luckily I was in the store when the call came in. I really did not understand the name of the person calling, and the place they were calling from was not stated during this call. The only information given was that I was being served papers. When I inquired what these papers were, it was for a debt that began 7 years ago. I kindly told them I would give them a call back as soon as I got home and would further discuss this with them. I was caught off guard that being threatened as soon as I got on the phone. Not only did they threaten me, they told my co-worker who answered the phone they were calling for me and that I was going to be served papers there the next day. 

Once I called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' back, XXXX claimed I had been mailed papers four weeks prior to this call. XXXX also stated that they were mailed to my place of employment. When I was confirming the address, it was my home address they had on file. I had not received any written explanation about this debt at the address they had on file, and have not received any written documents to this day, XX/XX/XXXX. While I was speaking with XXXX on the phone, he sent me an email of the debt that was owed. I was informed that the original debt was somewhere between {$500.00} and {$600.00}, the exact amount I do not recall. The email that I was sent, and the information that XXXX gave me over the phone, is that the settlement amount was {$1100.00}, but the balance on the card was at {$1800.00}. XXXX is now telling me the new settlement amount is {$830.00} ( if I am remembering correctly ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX again, after I had spoken with an attorney for myself, XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. She informed me she had previously had a call similar to mine about a scam and someone using "" XXXX '' as the name of their law firm, but she assured me it was not her. She informed me to contact the original holder of the card in order to track down this debt to know for sure if it was legitimate. Since then, I have contacted the original holder of the card and 6 other collection agencies, the most recent one the card was sold to in XX/XX/XXXX. I have been diligently working to find the owner of this account, but have hit a wall and not receiving calls back from the newest holder of this debt, which is not XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Also, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called my place of employment after speaking with me, and informed my boss that he would be faxing over wage garnishment forms to be filled out. My boss immediately called and notified me of this, and soon after XXXX called and told me wage garnishment papers would be faxed. I did inform XXXX I had spoken with my boss and informed her not to fill out anything until I knew this was not a scam. She agreed with me, after I told her all the details of what is going on. 

Since these calls started I have been in contact with the FTC, the FBI for possible identity theft since all of my personal information is in the email, trying to contact my state Attorney General, finding out the NC laws regarding being sued for a debt and the statute of limitations on being sued. I have researched the address on the email letterhead, which leads to an Executive tower in XXXX XXXX, but since there is no XXXX XXXX for this law group, I can not validate its legitimacy. I have researched the phone numbers, business name, checked with the California Bar Association, and I am unable to find this law group. 

I am now receiving more threatening calls, latest one was today XX/XX/XXXX, in which XXXX told me I will be served with court documents tomorrow at my place of employment.This now contradicts what was previously stated on the XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX went from being able to send the garnishment papers straight to my boss to having to appear in court and have it court ordered.

Every single month Nationstar fails to apply our payments to our account. Instead, they hold the fund in some reserve account that does not apply to our principal or accrued interest. Without fail, we have to call them to correct the mistake. Several times they have sent us letters saying our account is in default for not making payments, when in reality we were ahead of our payment schedule by several months. 

They also often fail to apply our extra payments to the principal, and instead apply them as regular payments in an attempt to increase the interest owed on the loan.

Once the note was transferred, I was notified that there was an overage in my escrow account and received an escrow analysis showing the overage of {$1100.00}. OCWEN informed me that I could not keep the money in the escrow account, so I chose to have the funds dispersed to me.

The Customer Service Representative I connected with was unable to explain any reason for the increase. With no acceptable explanation, I was transferred to an Escalation Manager. It was at this time that I requested an escrow analysis to determine the reason for the increase in my payment. Upon receiving the analysis, I then was informed that my payment would increase an additional {$91.00} to cover a projected shortage of {$3200.00} in equal payment spread out over 36 months.

360,"I used Discover Action > Student loans to take out a bar loan to sign-up for a bar prep course. I have been making monthly, on-time payments on the loan for over 2 years. The balance of the loan has actually gone up rather than going down, as one would suppose would happen. After researching the issue, I realized that Discover 's minimum payment amount was broken down in such a way as to ensure that the interest will always be XXXX times higher than the principal - high enough to ensure that the balance of the loan remained the same or slightly ticked up through the duration of the "" repayment '', thus ensuring that the loan would never be paid off by simply applying minimum payments. All of this means that at 7 % interest, if one were to pay off the loan by making double monthly payments, that I would pay double the amount of the loan, and that Discover would make a 100 % profit on a loan that is at 7 %. 

This practice is beyond the pale of decency and is incredibly unethical. These are effectively usury loan terms and your agency needs to become involved in making sure that individuals who are simply trying to better themselves and do n't have parents or others to contribute to their education are not left "" holding the bag '' because financial services companies are allowed to exploit their dominant market positions.

However, a substantial fraction of excess payment has been applied to the principal of the lower-interest rate loan for several months. Numerical context : - Autopaying $ XXXX/mo since XX/XX/XXXX. 
- Total Scheduled Monthly Payment is $ XXXX/mo. 
- One loan with period beginning XX/XX/XXXX, disbursed $ XXXX@ 5.96 % fixed, according to NSLDS student data extract ( not available from Great Lakes or from master promissory note ) Scheduled Monthly Payment is {$43.00}. 
- One loan with period beginning XX/XX/XXXX, disbursed $ XXXX@ 5.59 % fixed, according to NSLDS student data extract ( not available from Great Lakes or from master promissory note ) Scheduled Monthly Payment is {$280.00}. 

The Scheduled Monthly Payments by individual loan seem like they might be reversed. Regardless, assuming they are correct, the changes to the individual loan balances - and total account balance - do not reflect the rules for applying payments to individual loans ' Scheduled Monthly Payments first, then excess to the loan with the highest interest rate. 

( 2 ) Servicer claims that statements prior to XX/XX/XXXX can not be provided. I have bank statements showing transactions paid out to loan servicer monthly in XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and every month after.

Actions taken : * Set up spreadsheet model of monthly payments to trace calculation in statements provided online by Great Lakes.

* Contacted Great Lakes call center to inquire about ( 2 ) and ( 1 ).

Item : 1. Overpayments being used to offset future payments. 

As a Action > Student loan borrower, if you make an additional payment, or pay over the monthly amount, servicers are applying the overpayment against future month 's payment. 
This is incorrect. 
The payment amount is based on the amount of time that has been agreed to in paying off an loaned amount - any increases in payment or payment speed should shorten the principal amount owed - and thereby the amount of time required to pay. 

What these Action > Student loan servicers ( Granite State Management & Resources in my experience ) are doing is maintaining the original amount of interest due by not reducing the principal with amounts over the payment amount or payments that occur earlier than the agreed-to payment dates. 

They should not be allowed to receive any more amounts in interest than what is equivalent to the interest rate times the amount of funds x time borrowed. 
They should not be allowed to "" tack time on '' to increase the total interest payment amount, or maintain an artificially-higher level of payment distribution towards interest than towards principal. 
The requirement to a separate payment ( by mail, phone, etc. ) in order to get additional payment amounts to apply towards principal is in no way designed to assist the borrower. 

This is equivalent to a pre-payment penalty, and should not be allowed to be applied towards federal Action > Student loans just as prepayment penalties are no longer allowed to be applied towards private bank credit cards or any other private loan. 
This is ESPECIALLY predatory, since the loan can not be discharged in bankruptcy and certainly should not be allowed with Federally-guaranteed loans.

I have never been late on any of my payments and always sent in more than what was due. When I received the statement for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, it showed I had a past due amount of {$230.00}. I called the bank as I had made the previous months payment on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount due was {$230.00} and I made a payment of {$250.00}. The representative advised that there was a payment sitting in suspense which he would have applied and that I did n't even have to make a payment for XXXX, I told him I still wanted to make a payment in May and he advised that I should make a payment of {$160.00}. I also requested that a payment history be sent to me as I felt my payments were not being applied appropriately. So on XXXX I made the payment through my banks online bill payment for {$250.00}. The following month when I received the XX/XX/XXXX billing statement it showed yet again that I had a past due amount of {$160.00}. I called the bank again and spoke with a XXXX in the bankruptcy department who than transferred me to an XXXX in customer service. XXXX advised me she did n't know what was going on with my account as she did n't understand the payment history and that the bankruptcy department advises how to apply payments. She stated that it looked like I only had a payment due of {$90.00} as there were funds in suspense. XXXX advised that the next statement should show that the account is all squared away. Well I received the XX/XX/XXXX payment statement and it shows again that I have a past due amount of {$190.00} and a finance charge of {$180.00} for a total amount due of {$380.00}. So I pulled out all the statements I have saved to date and wrote down the payment dates and amounts to try and match to the payment history that was sent to me and could not follow how my payments were coming in or being applied. I sent in a payment XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00} and on XX/XX/XXXX for {$250.00} that I could n't see in the payment history as all the other payments showed an effective date of transaction on the payment history.

Also in reviewing the payment history that was sent to me which was from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I see that for the months of XXXX & XXXX  payments, the payments spiked to over {$300.00} due which is not in line with the normal payments due. I do understand that my HELOC is not a fixed rate but do n't understand the payments jumping that high for these 2 payment. The other thing I noticed in this history is that only 8 principal payments have been made in the 3 years, where has all the additional money I have been sending been applied? I also see a XXXX tran for F/C and B/R Expenses for {$650.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which was around the time I filed CHXXXX  bankruptcy, was this paid out of a non-recoverable account?

We 'd received similar letters ever so often notifying us that we could drop our PMI when our home reached the required loan-to-value ratio. Our current home is our third home, and we are familiar with the loan-to-value ratio requirements for dropping PMI. We put a smaller down payment on our current home because we bought it "" as-is '', and invested cash in renovations.

Unfortunately, when I called SLS in XX/XX/XXXX to ask how to go about getting our house appraised to check the current loan-to-value, an SLS representative told me only the "" Original Value '' of the home would be considered in loan-to-value calculations. I was disheartened to learn that our renovations and a new appraisal would not help us drop PMI with this company. I understand following the housing crisis policies have changed, but disregarding a well-documented ( receipts, appraisal, etc. ) appreciation in the value of someone 's home is unjustifiable. On the back of my SLS letter, it indicates that clients living in Texas, California, and Minnesota can use an appraisal to re-evaluate the loan-to-value of their home in efforts to eliminate PMI. As a North Carolina resident, I am wondering if there is a state law that prevents me from using an appraisal to prove appreciation to reassess loan-to-value or if this is an SLS policy.

497,"I am writing to call into question a judgment that was filed by the plaintiff XXXX XXXX. Docket number XXXX. This was filed back in late XXXX. Below I will try to outline the situation in order to keep this concise and to the point as I know. 
- In late XXXX, my wife and I extended our lease 20 days on a month to month in order to close on a home purchase. Original rent was {$1100.00}, they charged me {$3800.00} to extend 20 days. I believe last day would be XXXX XXXX, XXXX - Explained to them that I could not pay such a high price for the extra days and asked about paying the original {$1200.00} rent and making a payment plan to pay the remaining balance but they refused to take anything but the {$3800.00} in full. 
- They explained to me that they would have to go ahead and file for eviction but not to worry because eviction date would be after we had already moved out. 
- My wife and I have always paid rent on time so this was all new to us. They instructed me to not bother going to court because if we did not have full {$3800.00}, the judge would rule in their favor. 
- Misjudging that they were acting in everyone 's best interest I missed the court date and in doing so they filed judgment. I set up payment plan to pay amount within a few months ( paid {$600.00} ). 
- Home purchase fell through and was left with a negative collection on my credit report. No longer approved by lender. Could not find an apartment who would rent to us leaving me and my children homeless. Stopped making payments to XXXX and saved for large deposit. 
- Moved in to second chance apartments in order to clean up credit in XXXX of XXXX. 
- After 2 years of working to repair my credit and get this paid in order to proceed with home buying, the lender pulled my credit and found judgment filed with court differs from amount UDR claims I owe. 
- Court files show {$1200.00}, XXXX shows {$3100.00}. Called to pay XXXX billing to find discrepancy. Woman who refused to identify herself called me a criminal for not paying rent on time. I explained I never had a problem paying rent I had a problem with paying such a substantial amount. 
- When asked why amount differed she said it was for cleaning the apartment after move out. 
- XXXX rep stated she would not give letter of release of judgment until the {$3800.00} is paid in full. 
- I asked for copy of lease as well as addendum and UDR refused to give copy. Gave me contact to NCC Business who is the collection agency handling debt. 
- Written request 4 times remain unanswered and still no documentation was ever given as to why I owe so much for 20 days. 
- This has affected my family greatly and resolving this is the last obstacle in front of us for pre approval in purchasing a home.",Action > Debt collection,
